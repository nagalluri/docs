title: 'Step 4: Export your video'
description: 'You can export as your timeline as either an MP4 or XML file'

Once your edit is complete you can either
- Export to video as an MP4 video file
- Export as XML file to be used in Adobe Premiere Pro, DaVinci Resolve, or Final Cut Pro (Note: In DaVinci Resolve, you will have to import the XML file as a timeline via
File > Import > Timeline)

Congrats on editing your first video using Luminary!
