After importing your assets, you can now navigate back to the editor view and add either the audio or video voiceover(s) for your video. Click the "Add Voiceover" button in the text editor video
to select your voiceover content. The audio will then be transcribed into the text editor. 

You can now select and delete text in the text editor to make cuts to your timeline!
